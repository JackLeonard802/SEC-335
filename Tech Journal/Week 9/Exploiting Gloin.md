# Exploiting Gloin

## Target IP Address
I was able to use my [dns-resolver.sh](https://github.com/JackLeonard802/SEC-335/blob/main/Tech%20Journal/Source%20Code/dns-resolver.sh) script against the target network to enumerate the dns records for all of the hosts, including Gloin.
> note: The IP addresses are given in the reverse format

I was able to use nmap with the -sV flags on the host to scan ports 1-1000 and get the services running on those ports
